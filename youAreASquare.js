Description:
A square of squares

You like building blocks. You especially like building blocks that are squares. And what you even like more, is to arrange them into a square of square building blocks!

However, sometimes, you can't arrange them into a square. Instead, you end up with an ordinary rectangle! Those blasted things! If you just had a way to know, whether you're currently working in vainâ€¦ Wait! That's it! You just have to check if your number of building blocks is a perfect square.

Task

Given an integral number, determine if it's a square number:

In mathematics, a square number or perfect square is an integer that is the square of an integer; in other words, it is the product of some integer with itself.

The tests will always use some integral number, so don't worry about that in dynamic typed languages.

Examples

-1  =>  false
 0  =>  true
 3  =>  false
 4  =>  true
25  =>  true
26  =>  false


Key Concepts:
Math.square
Number.isInteger

*/
var isSquare = function(n){
  if (n < 0) return false; // negative numbers cannot be perfect squares
  const sqrt = Math.sqrt(n); //returns n square
  return Number.isInteger(sqrt);//verifies if a number is an integer
};

/* or
function isSquare(n){
  return Number.isInteger(Math.sqrt(n));
}
*/
